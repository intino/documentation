Konos is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) specifically designed to define the layers that interact with the business model within the [business unit](../). As an integral part of Intino’s hexagonal architecture, Konos facilitates the setup of ports and adapters which connect the core business logic to external applications and services. This enables clear and efficient communication boundaries between the internal operations of the application and the outside world.

## Key Functions of Konos

* **UI Definition:** Konos allows developers to design the user interface (UI) components of an application. This includes the layout, interactive elements, and overall user experience (UX) design. With Konos, the UI can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each business unit, ensuring that the interface is both functional and intuitive, enhancing user engagement and efficiency. A complete catalog of available components can be found [here](https://intino.systems/ui/).

* **API Configuration:** APIs are essential for enabling applications to communicate with each other and with external services. Konos provides the tools to define and configure these APIs, ensuring they are secure, reliable, and optimized for performance. This includes setting up endpoints, request/response formats, and integrating middleware for additional functionality like authentication and data validation.

* **BPM Tools:** Konos excels by allowing the definition and automation of business processes. These tools help map out workflows, decision trees, and conditional logic that dictate the operations of business units. By defining BPM with Konos, organizations can streamline operations, reduce redundancies, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

* **Periodic Commands and Operations:** Konos also supports the scheduling and execution of periodic commands and operations which are essential for tasks that need to run at regular intervals. This could include data synchronization, regular maintenance tasks, or batch processing jobs, all integral to keeping the application functional and up-to-date.

* **Datahub Integration:** Integration with the Datahub is a key feature enabled by Konos. It allows applications to interact seamlessly with the central data repository of Intino. Whether it’s pushing data to the Datahub or retrieving it, Konos ensures these interactions are smooth and efficient, facilitating a consistent flow of information across all business units.

* **Consuming External APIs:** Lastly, Konos provides the capability to integrate with external APIs. This allows business units to leverage third-party services and data, expanding their capabilities and integrating global best practices into their operations. Konos handles the complexities of API consumption, from handling API calls and processing responses to error handling and data transformation.
